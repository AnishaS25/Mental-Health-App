•	Middle Layer: Here where the app’s main brain does it work, like figuring out your mood from the data you input and guiding you through meditation exercises. It’s known as the ‘Application Tier’.
•	Bottom Layer: This is like a secure visit where all your personal information such as mood history and user profile is stored. It’s called ‘Data Tier’.
•	Each layer has its job the top layer handles what you see, the middle layer handles the app’s functions, and the bottom layer keeps your data safe. This setup helps keep app running smoothly and securely.
