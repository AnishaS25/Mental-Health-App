Chapter 3. Requirement Specification

3.1 Problem Definition
The system I’ll be developing is like a helpful friend for people’s mental health. It’s an app that offers tools and support to help users feel better emotionally and mentally. Think of it as a place where people can go when they’re feeling stressed, anxious or just need a little pick me up. This app will have features like mood tracking, meditation sessions, and stress relief techniques to help users manage their emotions. It will also connect users with offers who understand what they’re going through, creating a supportive community where people can share their experiences and find encouragement. Overall, this app aims to make taking care of your mental health easier and more accessible for everyone.
Let me give you an insight of the system flow. The system flow of my app involves:
1. User Registration/Login:
 Users will start by registering for an account or logging into the app. This step ensures that each user has a personalized experience and access to their data.

Once logged in, users can track their mood using the app’s mood tracking feature. They can select their current mood from predefined options or input their own feelings using text or emojis.

6. Feedback and Improvement:
 Throughout the user journey, this app collects feedback from users through surveys, ratings, or direct input. This feedback is used to improve the app’s features, content, and users experience continuously.

Yess is there any option where we can connect with professional psychologist for consultation
Not really....the app seems great already
I think mental health is directly connected to yoga, meditation, and spiritual beliefs, so if possible, the application must help me to meditate by providing the benefits of it and also the sounds that can be heard while meditating.
May be good tips to ease out the schedule
